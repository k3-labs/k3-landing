                    including, but not limited to, the risk of malicious
                    software introduction, the risk that third parties may
                    obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or

                    Wallet secure and you should never share your Wallet

                    for your Client Account and any associated Wallet and we are
                    not, and will not be, liable for any acts or omissions by
                    you in connection with your Client Account or as a result of

                    or otherwise alienate your Assets unless instructed by you
                    or as otherwise authorized by these Terms. For the avoidance
                    of doubt, the Company makes no representations to any party
                    that any Asset is free and clear of any security interest or
                    other lien or encumbrance.

                    interacts with the Service (“Supported Assets”), and may

                    Supplemental Benefit shall be made by the Company in our

                    You acknowledge that your interactions with an Asset and the

                    third-party smart contract that governs the Asset. You are
                    solely responsible for understanding the applicable smart
                    contract and verifying whether it operates as you expect it
                    to. The Company shall not be responsible or liable for any

                Software Platform hereunder, the Client shall pay the fees as
                set forth in, and in accordance with, the order form(s) or, if
                this Agreement is not incorporated by reference into an order
                form, the fees set forth on the Site, (the “Order Form”)
                executed (including executed or agreed to electronically) by
                Client, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
                Except as set forth in an Order Form, the Company may change any
                fees, payments or charges at its discretion at any time upon
                notice to Client. Such revisions shall take effect in the first

                may be purchased by you, if specified in the Order Form. PREPAID
                CREDIT IS NONREFUNDABLE. Prepaid credit that you have
                individually and directly purchased for cash will not expire.
                Credit that you have received as an “add on” to a subscription,
                or have received as a promotion, gift or otherwise not purchased
                individually and directly for cash, may expire at the Company’s
                discretion. The price of prepaid credit will be the price

                invoice shall be paid by Client on or before the tenth (10th)
                day of receipt. If a delinquency occurs, the Company may, at its
                option (and without relieving Client from its payment
                obligations), revoke, suspend or disclaim Client’s right to
                utilize any of the Software Platform (including the Client
                Account), and all other rights of Client hereunder, until
                payment in full is made. Client shall be liable to the Company
                for all costs and expenses of collection, including reasonable
                attorneys’ fees, and court costs with respect to any delinquent
                payment. In the event that the Client disputes any amount shown
                due on any invoice, the Client shall pay any undisputed portions
                of such amount and send written notice to the Company detailing
                any disputed portions of such amount.

                effective date of such termination, and shall have no obligation
                to pay any Fees that pertain to an annual billing period that

                terminate this Agreement for any reason upon notice to the other
                party; provided, however, that: (a) the exercise of such right
                of termination shall not limit any other rights or remedies of
                the terminating party at law, in equity or hereunder; and (b)
                there shall not be an available cure or notice period for any
                material breach by Client, including, without limitation,
                Client’s breach of (i) proprietary and/or confidentiality
                obligations or (ii) any of its obligations hereunder with

                    dissemination or publication of such Confidential
                    Information as Receiving Party uses to protect its own
                    Proprietary Information of a like nature and as it uses to
                    protect the financial terms of this Agreement.

                    You and the Company agree to arbitrate any dispute arising

                    New York County, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over
                    any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit
                    between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than
                    class procedures and remedies discussed below, the
                    arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would
                    otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the

                (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
                that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
                other than the State of Delaware. Venue and jurisdiction for any

                remedies at law and that such other party may be entitled to
                equitable relief in addition to all other remedies available to
                it. Each party agrees that, if a court of competent jurisdiction
                determines that such party has breached, or attempted or
                threatened to breach, its obligations pursuant to Section 5, the
                other party will be entitled to obtain appropriate injunctive
                relief and other measures restraining further, attempted or
                threatened breaches of such obligations. Such relief or measures
                shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights
                and remedies available to such aggrieved party.

                event beyond the control of the Company which occurs after the
                Effective Date and which was not reasonably foreseeable at that
